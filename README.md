# 📚 DSA in C++ – Apna College Progress

This repository tracks my learning journey in **Data Structures & Algorithms using C++**, following the YouTube series by [Apna College](https://www.youtube.com/@ApnaCollegeOfficial). I'm working on this during my semester break to build strong programming fundamentals.

## 🚀 Highlights

- ✅ Complete understanding of Kadane's Algorithm
- ✅ Fully working custom `vector<T>` class implemented from scratch using dynamic arrays and templates
- ✅ Chapter 8 homework problems solved with clean and modular C++ code
- ✅ Files compiled and tested on Windows (`.exe` for quick execution)
- 💡 Code aligns with Apna College's lectures and assignments

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Complete the full Apna College DSA C++ series
- Practice implementing each data structure from scratch
- Strengthen problem-solving and logic-building skills
- Document and share my progress through this GitHub repo

## 🛠️ How to Use

You can compile any `.cpp` file using your favorite C++ compiler.

Example using `g++`:
```
g++ arrays/intersection.cpp -o arrays/intersection.exe
./arrays/intersection.exe
```

## 📌 Note
All code is written for educational purposes as I learn.<br>
I'm open to suggestions and feedback from fellow learners! 😊
